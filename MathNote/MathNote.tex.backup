\begin{verbatim}
在我年轻的时候, 我听从建议去读庞加莱, 希尔伯特, 克莱因以及胡尔维茨等的著作,
并从中获益. 而我自己对布拉须凯, 嘉当和霍普夫的著作更为熟悉, 其实这也是中国
的传统: 在中国我们被教导要读孔夫子, 韩愈的散文以及杜甫的诗歌, 我真诚地希望
这套全集不要成为书架上的摆设, 而是在年轻数学家的手里被翻烂掉.

\chapter{复变函数}
\bq{http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/294383}{20170405001}
求$\int_0^{+\infty}\left(\frac{x}{\ue^x-\ue^{-x}}-\frac12\right)\frac1{x^2}\ud x$.
\eq
\ba
留数法. 首先
\bee
\int_0^{\infty}\left(\frac{x}{\ue^x-\ue^{-x}}-\frac{1}{2}\right)\frac1{x^2}\ud x
  =\frac{1}{2}\int_0^{\infty}\frac{x-\sinh x}{x^2\sinh x}\ud x.
\eee
被积函数记为$f(x)$, $f(x)$是奇函数, 故
\bee
LHS=\frac{1}{4}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{x-\sinh x}{x^2\sinh x}\ud x
  = \frac{1}{4}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2\pi\ui\Res\left(\frac{x-\sinh x}{x^2\sinh x}, \ui n\pi\right)
  = -\frac{\ln 2}{2}.
\eee
另见\ref{un:20170405un1}.

\bq{}{}
区域$D$内单叶解析函数$f(z)$的导数必不为零.
