\begin{question}
	If $f$ is of bounded variation,
	does $f'$ exist at enough points to at least be integrable? And what does it mean for a
	function to be integrable anyway? Our first attempt to salvage the formula will be to
	write it in the "differential" form $\int_{a}^{b}\left|\ud f\right|$, and, for this to make sense, we will need
	more detailed information about integrals.
